I created a fully responsive landing page designed to highlight a selection of products such as headphones, smartphones, and charging devices. The page utilizes HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to deliver a modern and engaging user experience. I employed Flexbox and Grid for efficient and flexible layout management, ensuring optimal display on various screen sizes. Semantic HTML was used to enhance accessibility and improve search engine rankings. Additionally, I implemented smooth scrolling functionality to enable effortless navigation between different sections of the page.
